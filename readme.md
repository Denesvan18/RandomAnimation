# JavaScript Random Animation

This simple JavaScript example code is used to generate a random animation effect on a webpage.

## Usage

1. Copy and paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into the respective files in your project.
2. In your HTML page, add a container element (e.g., `<div>`) and give it a unique ID (e.g., `animated-element`).
3. Open your HTML page, and you should see a red square moving randomly across the page.

## Code Explanation

- The `getRandomPosition()` function generates random x and y coordinates to ensure the animation element appears at random positions within the window.
- The `animateElement()` function moves the animation element to a newly generated random position.
- The `setInterval(animateElement, 1000)` function executes the `animateElement()` function every 1 second, creating the animation effect.

## Demo

You can view the animation effect in a browser by visiting the [example page](index.html).

## Customization

You can customize the style of the animation element, movement frequency, and other animation effects as per your project requirements.
